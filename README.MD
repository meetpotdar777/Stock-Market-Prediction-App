Stock Market Prediction App

This Python application leverages historical stock data, technical indicators, and economic data to predict future stock prices using machine learning models. It supports training a new model or loading an existing one, and visualizes the model's performance along with a future price prediction.

Features

Historical Data Fetching: Downloads historical stock data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adjusted Close) using yfinance.

Economic Data Integration: Fetches key economic indicators (Federal Funds Rate, CPI, Unemployment Rate) from the FRED API to enrich the feature set.

Comprehensive Feature Engineering:

Calculates various technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, OBV, Stochastic Oscillator, ROC, CMF, PVT, Rolling Volatility).

Generates lagged features for better time-series forecasting.

Extracts temporal features like Day of Week, Day of Month, Week of Year, Month of Year, and Quarter of Year.

Calculates Rate of Change (ROC) for economic indicators.

Data Preprocessing: Scales features using StandardScaler for optimal model performance.

Machine Learning Models: Supports different regression models, with a focus on LGBMRegressor for its performance and speed, including hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV and TimeSeriesSplit for robust time-series validation.

Model Persistence: Saves and loads trained models, scalers, and feature columns using joblib to avoid retraining.

Prediction: Predicts the stock price for a specified number of days into the future.

Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted historical prices and clearly marks the single future prediction on the same chart.

Installation

To run this application, you'll need Python 3.7+ and several libraries.

Clone the repository (if applicable) or save the main.py file:

git clone <repository-url>
cd Stock Market Prediction App

(Or simply save the Python script as main.py or main6.py as per your current file name)

Install the required Python packages:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance scikit-learn lightgbm ta fredapi

Obtain a FRED API Key:

Go to the FRED API website.

Register for a free API key.

Update the FRED_API_KEY variable in the main.py script with your obtained key. This is crucial if you want to use economic indicators for predictions.

# stock_predictior_version_1.py (or stock_predictior_version_9.py)
FRED_API_KEY = "YOUR_FRED_API_KEY_HERE" # Replace with your actual FRED API key

Usage
You can run the script directly from your terminal.

python stock_predictior_version_1.py
# or if you named it stock_predictior_version_1.py or stock_predictior_version_9.py
python stock_predictior_version_9.py

The script will:

Check for existing trained models. If found, it will load them. Otherwise, it will train a new model.

Fetch historical stock data for the specified STOCK_TICKER.

Fetch economic data from FRED (if FRED_API_KEY is set).

Perform feature engineering and data scaling.

Train (or load) and evaluate the chosen machine learning model.

Display performance metrics (RMSE, R-squared).

Predict the future stock price.

Generate a plot visualizing historical actual vs. predicted prices, and the future prediction.

Configuration

You can customize the application's behavior by modifying the variables in the --- Configuration --- section of the script:

STOCK_TICKER: The stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOG").

START_DATE: The start date for fetching historical data (e.g., "2020-01-01").

CUSTOM_END_DATE: Set to a specific date string ("YYYY-MM-DD") if you want to define the end of your historical data. Set to None to use today's date.

N_LAG_DAYS: Number of past days to use for creating lagged features.

PREDICT_N_DAYS_FUTURE: Number of days into the future to predict the close price.

MODEL_CHOICE: Choose your machine learning model: 'LinearRegression', 'RandomForestRegressor', or 'LGBMRegressor'.

FRED_API_KEY: Your personal API key for FRED data.

File Structure

The main logic is contained within a single Python script (e.g., main.py or main6.py).
Upon execution, it will create (or use) the following files in the same directory:

AAPL_stock_prediction_model_lgbmregressor.joblib: The trained machine learning model.

AAPL_scaler_lgbmregressor.joblib: The fitted StandardScaler object used for feature scaling.

AAPL_feature_columns_lgbmregressor.joblib: A list of the feature column names used during training, ensuring consistency for future predictions.
(Note: The exact names will depend on your STOCK_TICKER and MODEL_CHOICE.)

Model Details

The application primarily uses LGBMRegressor, a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It's chosen for its efficiency, speed, and accuracy, especially with large datasets. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using RandomizedSearchCV combined with TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen time-series data.

Troubleshooting

DNSError or Failed download from yfinance: This indicates a network or DNS resolution issue on your machine.

Check your internet connection.

Try ping query1.finance.yahoo.com in your terminal.

Temporarily disable your firewall/antivirus.

Consult your network administrator if you are on a corporate network.

FRED_API_KEY warning/error: Ensure you have obtained a valid FRED API key and correctly replaced "YOUR_FRED_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual key in the script. If your model was trained with economic features but you run it without a valid key, it will lead to errors during prediction.

"Not enough processed data points to make a prediction": This means the START_DATE is too recent or required_history_days is not large enough for all technical indicators and lag features to be calculated without resulting in all NaN rows after dropna(). Consider extending START_DATE further back in time.

"AttributeError: module 'matplotlib.pyplot' has no attribute 'autoscale_view'": This has been addressed in the latest script version by removing the problematic call. Ensure you are using the most up-to-date code.

Chart Dates: The chart visualization is designed to correctly align historical predictions with their actual dates and extend a line to the single future predicted date. Ensure your data ranges are reasonable for clear visualization.

Future Enhancements

Multiple Future Day Predictions: Extend the prediction functionality to forecast multiple days into the future, possibly showing a prediction curve.

Interactive Visualization: Implement an interactive plot using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for zoom, pan, and tooltip functionalities.

User Interface: Develop a simple web-based UI using Flask/Django or Streamlit for easier interaction.

Model Ensemble: Combine predictions from multiple models for potentially better accuracy.

News Sentiment Analysis: Integrate news sentiment data as an additional feature.

Robust Error Handling: More granular error handling and user feedback.

Cloud Deployment: Deploy the model as an API for easy access.
